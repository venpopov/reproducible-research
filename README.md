A list of resources for reproducible research. I work primarily with R, so these resources are selected with that in mind. This list is a work in-progress.

## Basic resources

- [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) - an IDE for R that facilitates projects
- [Quatro](https://quarto.org/) - an open-source scientific and technical publishing system
- [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) - an R package for managing project dependencies
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - a web-based platform for version control and collaboration
- [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) - a web-based platform for creating interactive computational environments from code repositories
- [OSF](https://osf.io/) - the Open Science Framework, a free and open-source project management tool for researchers
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - a platform for building, packaging, and distributing applications as containers
- [rang](https://gesistsa.github.io/rang/) - reconstruct reproducible R environments from older projects 
- [groundhog](https://groundhogr.com/) - load or install R packages available at a specific date
- [fusen](https://thinkr-open.github.io/fusen/) - build an R package from an Rmarkdown file
- [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) - an R package for creating pipelines for data science
- [gert](https://github.com/r-lib/gert) - a simple git client for R

## Quatro

- [awesome-quarto](https://github.com/mcanouil/awesome-quarto) - A curated list of resources and tools for using Quarto, a document automation tool for reproducible research

### Example research projects built with Quarto

- [self-reference](https://www.crumplab.com/self-reference/) - a master's thesis on the Self Reference Effect written in Quarto
- [indo-rct](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/indo-rct/) - a reproduction of a traditionally published paper using Quarto
